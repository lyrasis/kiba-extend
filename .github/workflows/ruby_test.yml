# This workflow uses actions that are not certified by GitHub.
# They are provided by a third-party and are governed by
# separate terms of service, privacy policy, and support
# documentation.
# This workflow will download a prebuilt Ruby version, install dependencies and run tests with Rake
# For more information see: https://github.com/marketplace/actions/setup-ruby-jruby-and-truffleruby

# This runs only on pull requests because (1) no one should be pushing anything that can break tests
#   to main!; and (2) I want to be able to push documentation-only changes to main without waiting for
#   tests to run
