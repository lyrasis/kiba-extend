      # ## Using Cspace transforms when your project defines a Cspace module
      #
      # If you get errors running jobs containing transforms in the
      #   Kiba::Extend::Cspace namespace in your project, and you have defined
      #   a Cspace module in your project, you will need to write the transform
      #   like:
      #
      # ```
      # transform Kiba::Extend::Transforms::Cspace::NormalizeForID,
      #   source: :field,
      #   target: :norm
      # ```
      #
      # ## Other transforms of special relevance to CollectionSpace jobs
      #
      # - {Append::ConvertedValueAndUnit} - For augmenting Object dimension
      #   values
      # - {Name} transforms for Person authorities
      # - {Fingerprint} transforms for preparing cleanup worksheets for clients
      #   and merging completed worksheets back into migration projects
      # - {Reshape::CollapseMultipleFieldsToOneTypedFieldPair} - often useful
      #   for preparing phone type and email type fields
      # - {CombineValues::AcrossFieldGroup} and
      #   {Collapse::FieldsToRepeatableFieldGroup} - different approaches to
      #   generating data for repeatable field groups.
      #   {CombineValues::AcrossFieldGroup} makes sense if the data to be
      #   combined exists in basically the right "shape" for combining. You can
      #   just define what source fields map to what target fields without
      #   renaming fields in a particular way. When you have to explode,
      #   reshape, or create source data into a combinable form, and you can do
      #   that buy creating fields using a consistent naming convention,
      #   {Collapse::FieldsToRepeatableFieldGroup} is a simpler transform
      #   to set up, and applies {Clean::EmptyFieldGroups} automatically
