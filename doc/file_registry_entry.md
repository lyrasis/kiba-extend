# File Registry Entry

## Note: SourceDestRegistry

`Kiba::Extend::Registry::FileRegistryEntry` mixes in the `Kiba::Extend::Registry::SourceDestRegistry` module, which provides certain information about source and destination types necessary for validating them and preparing entries using them for use in jobs. 

If you create/use a new source or destination type in your File Registry, it will need to be added to `SourceDestRegistryConstant` or you will get errors.

(This is one of the signs I made a poor design choice around FileRegistryEntry modeling, which I now thing needs to be re-implemented using the Strategy pattern or something else. But here it is for now.)

## File Registry Data hashes in your ETL application

A file registry entry is initialized with a Hash of data about the file. This Hash will be sent from your ETL application. 

The allowable Hash keys, expected Hash value formats, and expectations about them are described below.

### `:path` 
[String] full or expandable relative path to the expected location of the file**

* default: `nil`
* required if either `:src_class` or `:dest_class` requires a path (in `PATH_REQ`)
  
### `:src_class`
[Class] the Ruby class used to read in data

* default: value of `Kiba::Extend.source` (`Kiba::Common::Sources::CSV` unless overridden by your ETL app)
* required, but default supplied if not given

### `:src_opt`
[Hash] file options used when reading in source

* default: value of `Kiba::Extend.csvopts`
* required, but default supplied if not given

### `:dest_class`
[Class] the Ruby class used to write out the data

* default: value of `Kiba::Extend.destination` (`Kiba::Extend::Destinations::CSV` unless overridden by your ETL app)
* required, but default supplied if not given

### `:dest_opt`
[Hash] file options used when writing data

* default: value of `Kiba::Extend.csvopts`
* required, but default supplied if not given

### `:dest_special_opts`
[Hash] additional options for writing out the data

* Not all destination classes support extra options. If you provide unsupported extra options, they will not be sent through to the destination class, and you will receive a warning in STDOUT. The current most common use is to define `initial_headers` (i.e. which columns should be first in file) to `Kiba::Extend::Destinations::CSV`.
* optional
  
```ruby
reghash = {
  path: '/path/to/file.csv',
  dest_class: Kiba::Extend::Destinations::CSV,
  dest_special_opts: { initial_headers: %i[objectnumber briefdescription] }
  }
```

### `:creator`
[Method, Module] Ruby method that generates this file

* Used to run ETL jobs to create necessary files, if said files do not exist
* Not required at all if file is supplied
* If the method that runs the job is a module instance method named `job`, you can just specify the module

This is valid: 

```ruby
# in job definitions
module Project
  module Table 
    module_function

    def job
	  Kiba::Extend::Jobs::Job.new(
	   ...
	  )
	end
  end
end

# in file registry
reghash = {
  path: '/project/working/objects_prep.csv',
  creator: Project::Table
}
```

If you have defined multiple jobs per module or your job definition is not named `job`, you need to specify the method: 

```ruby
# in job definitions
module Project
  module Table 
    module_function

    def prep
	  Kiba::Extend::Jobs::Job.new(
	   ...
	  )
	end
  end
end

# in file registry
reghash = {
  path: '/project/working/objects_prep.csv',
  creator: Project::Table.method(:prep)
}
```

Note the following pattern!:

    Class or Module constant name + `.method` + method name **as symbol**

### `:supplied`
[true, false] whether the file/data is supplied from outside the ETL

- default: false
- Manually set to true for:
  - original data files from client
  - mappings/reconciliations to be merged into the ETL/migration
  - any other files created external to the ETL, which only need to be read from and never generated by the ETL process
	
Both of the following are valid:

```ruby
reghash = {
  path: '/project/working/objects_prep.csv',
  creator: Project::ClientData::ObjectTable.method(:prep)
}

reghash = {
  path: '/project/clientData/objects.csv',
  supplied: true
}
```

Note the following pattern!:

    Class or Module constant name + `.method` + method name **as symbol**

### `:lookup_on`
[Symbol] column to use as keys in lookup table created from file data

* required if file is used as a lookup source
* You can register the same file multiple times under different file keys with different `:lookup_on` values if you need to use the data for different lookup purposes

### `:desc`
[String] description of what the file is/what it is used for. Used when post-processing reports results to STDOUT

* optional

###`:tags`
[Array<Symbol>] list of arbitrary tags useful for categorizing data/jobs in your ETL

* optional
* If set, you can filter to run only jobs tagged with a given tag
* Tags I commonly use: 
  * :report_problems - reports that indicate something unexpected or that I need to do more work
  * :report_fyi - informational reports
  * :cspace - final files ready to import
